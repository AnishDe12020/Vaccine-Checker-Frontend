This is a small project which notifies users whenever a new vaccination slot is available. It comprises of a frontenc written in javascript and a backend written in python.
The backend code can be found in this [Github repository](https://github.com/AnishDe12020/Vacccine-Checker-Backend).

The webapp is currently hosted at [https://vaccine-checker-anishde12020.vercel.app/](https://vaccine-checker-anishde12020.vercel.app/)

**Note: The backend part is not hosted anywhere as of now so it won't really alert you just yet**

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
